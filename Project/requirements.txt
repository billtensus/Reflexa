# TensorFlow Lite:
# Option A (smaller): tflite-runtime manylinux wheel (ensure wheel matches target platform)
# If you expect to run on Cloud Run x86_64 and have a compatible wheel you can enable this.
# Many builds will instead use the full tensorflow package which is larger but more portable.
# Uncomment the option you want:
# tflite-runtime==2.9.0
# OR use full tensorflow (larger image):
# tensorflow>=2.9.0
